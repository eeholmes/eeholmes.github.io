## Multivariate time-series analysis

Looking for R packages for time-series analysis ([MARSS](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/MARSS/), atsar, ...)? Head to our 
[NWFSC Time Series](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/) page.  Packages, course webpage and Applied Time-Series Analysis book is there.

Most of my code is on GitHub and organized into the following organizations:

* Time series analysis [nwfsc-timeseries](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries)
* Working with remote sending data [ocean-satellite-tools](https://github.com/ocean-satellite-tools)
* R Workflow [RVerse-Tutorials](https://github.com/RVerse-Tutorials)
* Catch forecasting [Fish-Forecast](https://github.com/Fish-Forecast)

Other random stuff is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/eeholmes) page.  However, if you are looking for time-series analysis or hierarchical modeling code, then you should look at my [collegues](https://eeholmes.github.io/colleagues/)' GitHub repositories and project pages.
