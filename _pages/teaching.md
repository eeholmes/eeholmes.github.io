<strong>Emerging approaches for the analysis of stochastic ecological data:  dealing with multiple error sources, hidden states, complex non-linearities, and uncertainty.</strong>
<p>
Real population processes are stochastic.  Thus any analysis of population data must deal with this characteristic in some fashion.  The traditional approach has been to interpret population data via models attributing variability within the data to either measurement error or process error alone.  However, population data almost always contain multiple sources of variability: process error, measurement error, non-linear feedbacks, etc.  Mis-attributing the sources of variability has multiple consequences ranging from misestimation of the population behavior to misestimation of the level of uncertainty associated with the data analysis.  Fitting biologically motivated models to data from stochastic population processes with multiple sources of variability presents difficult challenges.  Recently ecologists have made significant in-roads into these problems.  This session features talks using these new approaches to analyze population data.

<strong>Modern paradigms in population ecology: stochastic, statistical, and inferential</strong>
<p>
In the last 10 years, the study of population and community dynamics has shifted towards stochastic models away from the deterministic models so familiar in ecology during the last century.  Understanding of the properties of stochastic versions of familiar ecological models is an active area of research, and along the way, the field of theoretical ecology is shifting to new paradigms of thinking about ecological processes.  The familiar concept of population state or carrying capacity as a fixed line passing through a series of observations is not particularly meaningful in a stochastic framework, and is replaced by the concept of stationary probability distributions.  The concept of equilibria is replaced by the concepts of inflection points in first passage probabilities and modes and antimodes in stationary distributions.  At the same time, there has been a fundamental shift away from qualitative visual comparisons of model output with qualitative system behavior, and towards rigorous statistical linking of stochastic ecological models and observations using modern, often numerical, statistical methods, which are suited for non-linear stochastic models which include both process and non-process variability.  Concepts such as likelihood surfaces, first passage distributions, conditional probability distributions, prior and posterior distributions, numerical statistical algorithms, and formal model support have joined nonlinear dynamics and stability as permanent parts of the landscape of ecological understanding.  This session features some of the contemporary research on stochastic ecological dynamics and estimation that is changing the face of population ecology and that will ultimately fundamentally change the way we think about and make inferences about ecological processes.
