Most of my research is on [GitHub](https://github.com/eeholmes) and organized into the following organizations:

* Time series analysis [nwfsc-timeseries](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries)
* Working with remote sensing data [ocean-satellite-tools](https://github.com/ocean-satellite-tools)
* R Workflow [RVerse-Tutorials](https://github.com/RVerse-Tutorials)
* Catch forecasting [Fish-Forecast](https://github.com/Fish-Forecast). Lectures, labs, and an [online book]("https://fish-forecast.github.io/Fish-Forecast-Bookdown/) on catch forecasting from a recent short course.

My big current projects are

* [Applied Time-Series Analysis for Fisheries and Environmental Data](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/): Course webpage, [MARSS](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/MARSS) R packages, and [atsar](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsar) R package for Bayesian MARSS models, and our [online book](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa-labs).
* **Open-science workflow** I am involved in a few different efforts and 2021 has had me running a bunch of workshops. [Scientific workflow training](<p https://rverse-tutorials.github.io), [Openscapes cohorts](https://www.openscapes.org/), [R-Govys](https://rgovys.github.io/) new R consortium working group to support R-users in government.
* [Global Upwelling](https://github.com/UW-Upwelling-Project). Brand new project on changing patterns of coastal upwelling.

My research is focused on stochastic processes and statistical models for complex multivariate, interacting systems. Much of what I do involves developing algorithms for fitting multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models to time-series data, which comes up in vector autoregressive state-space modeling, dynamic linear modeling, MAR(1) modeling, and dynamic factor analysis. I developed an EM algorithm for fitting a general constrained version of these models and develped the MARSS package for fitting such models. In my spare time, I've been working on predictive models of "multi-player" systems---I've been studying this with soccer match data. This is another application of my work on developing predictive models using 'bad' data. 

I am part of a NWFSC research group working in the area of hierarchical modeling and inference. Group members include myself, [Eric Ward](https://ericward-noaa.github.io/), [Mark Scheuerell](http://faculty.washington.edu/scheuerl/), and [Jim Thorson](https://sites.google.com/site/thorsonresearch/), along with their post-docs and students. We develop statistical methods for ecological problems and apply these to resource and endangered species management questions. We collaborate a lot with folks at the University of Washington School for Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences (SAFS).
