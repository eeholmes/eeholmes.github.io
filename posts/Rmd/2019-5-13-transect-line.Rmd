I have been working the last 5 years on a project having to do with the upwelling zones off the coast of India.  As part of this, I have been working on ways to visualize the upwelling zone---a spatial and temporal visualization problem.

## Gifs and movies

The first example I have is how to make a movie (or gif) from remote-sensing data.

I have two vignettes that show how to do this:

-   [Movie from Gifs of SST off the SW Coast of India 2015-2017](https://ocean-satellite-tools.github.io/RM_Gifs/Kochin_SST_2015-17_movie.html)

## Colorbar plot

The second example is how to make a colorbar over time and space. Here is an example of chlorophyll off the coast of India in 2010. It is not very interesting since there are many NAs, but you get the idea.
